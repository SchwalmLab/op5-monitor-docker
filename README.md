## Install

Pull the docker image from Docker Hub:

```

or, clone this repo to your docker server and build it:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/misiupajor/op5-monitor-docker.git
```

```sh
$ docker build --rm -t op5com/op5-monitor .
```

```

Now you can reach OP5 Monitor on:

https://`<docker server>`:443

## Adding hooks

You can add custom hooks by adding any script to entrypoint.d/hooks/ directory. Ensure that they are well defined in entrypoint.d/hooks.json, something like this will work:

```json
{
        "prestart": [
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/slack.py",
                "args": ["prestart"]
            },
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/example.sh",
                "args": ["--action", "contained_started"]
            }
        ],
        "poststart": [
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/slack.py",
                "args": ["poststart"]
            },
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/example.sh",
                "args": ["--action", "contained_booted"]
            }
        ],
        "poststop":[
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/slack.py",
                "args": ["poststop"]
            },
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/example.sh",
                "args": ["--action", "container_stopped"]
            }
        ]
}
```

And then build:

```sh
$ docker build --rm -t op5com/op5-monitor .
```

## Importing OP5 backup files

You can import existing OP5 backups. This can be helpful when you need to spin up an identical copy of your production OP5 servers, say for testing or development purposes.

In order to do so, you first need to create a **compatible** backup for docker on one of your OP5 master or peer server, using:
```sh
$ op5-backup -- -ssh -sysconfig -op5-system
```

Then place the backup file generated by op5-backup (ends with .backup-extension) in entrypoint.d/backups/, and re-build and run your docker container:

```sh
$ docker build --rm -t op5com/op5-monitor .
```

```sh
$ docker run -tid -e IMPORT_BACKUP=<name of backup file>.backup -p 443:443 op5com/op5-monitor
```

## Importing OP5 license keys

You can import your OP5 license key if needed. If not specified, it defaults to the trial license.

In order to do so, place your license key (eg. op5license.lic) in entrypoint.d/license/, and re-build and run your docker container:

```sh
$ docker build --rm -t op5com/op5-monitor .
```

```sh
$ docker run -tid -e LICENSE_KEY=<name of license key>.lic -p 443:443 op5com/op5-monitor
```
