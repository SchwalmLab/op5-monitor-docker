## Adding hooks

You can add custom hooks by adding any script to /entrypoint.d/hooks/ directory. Ensure that they are well defined in /entrypoint.d/hooks.json, something like this will work:

```json
{
        "prestart": [
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/slack.py",
                "args": ["prestart"]
            },
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/example.sh",
                "args": ["--action", "contained_started"]
            }
        ],
        "poststart": [
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/slack.py",
                "args": ["poststart"]
            },
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/example.sh",
                "args": ["--action", "contained_booted"]
            }
        ],
        "poststop":[
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/slack.py",
                "args": ["poststop"]
            },
            {
                "path": "/usr/libexec/entrypoint.d/hooks/example.sh",
                "args": ["--action", "container_stopped"]
            }
        ]
}
```

And then build:

```sh
$ docker build --rm -t op5com/op5-monitor .
```

## Importing OP5 backup files

This docker container supports importing and restoring of existing OP5 backups. This can be helpful when you need to spin up an identical copy of your production OP5 servers, say for testing or development purposes.

In order to do so, you first need to create a **compatible** backup for docker on one of your OP5 master or peer server, using:
```sh
$ op5-backup -- -op5-system -ssh
```

Then place the backup file generated by op5-backup (ends with .backup-extension) in entrypoint.d/backups/, and finally run your docker container as follows:

```sh
$ docker build --rm -t op5com/op5-monitor .
```

```sh
$ docker run -tid -e IMPORT_BACKUP=<name of backup file>.backup -p 443:443 op5com/op5-monitor
```
